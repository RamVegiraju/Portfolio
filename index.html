            <br>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ram Vegiraju and I am a rising senior at the University of Virginia majoring in Statistics with minors in Computer Science and 
                Mathematics. I am passionate about understanding the theory behind Machine/Deep Learning algorithms and implementing full-stack data science solutions
                on the cloud for interesting problems in fields such as NLP, Computer Vision, Time-Series, and Bioinformatics. I am hoping to continue my education with a
                Masters of Data Science post graduation while working full-time next year. Feel free to check out my Education/Skills below and some of my projects
                and hobbies in the other sections!
            </p>

            <h3>R&D Solutions Architect Intern Amazon Web Services</h3>
            <h4>June 2020-August 2020</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>- <b>Objective: Worked on the R&D team to develop and deploy a full stack Neural Machine Translation prototypes for client. Presented
                    weekly demos to clients and gained extensive experience with various AWS services: Lambda, S3, API Gateway, CloudFormation,
                    Cognito, Sagemaker, ECR, Amplify, and KMS.
                </b></li>
                <li>- React/Javascript: Utilized AWS Amplify to create a front-end dashboard with authentication through AWS Cognito.
                    Application processes client inputs and accesses a REST API created through AWS API Gatway.
                </li>
                <li>- Python: Developed AWS Lambda functions that query and store inputs in AWS S3. Utilized AWS Python SDK (boto3) to
                    connect to AWS Translate and AWS Sagemaker endpoint and return outputs to the front-end while storing results in S3.
                </li>
                <li>- NLP/ML: Worked with NLTK, Spacy, and Transformers libraries to preprocess and tokenize languages prior to modelling. Developed,
                    trained, and tuned a seq2seq model for translation. Deployed model using Docker with ECR, and accessed endpoint for inference through Lambda.
                </li>
                <li>- CloudFormation: Helped develop Bash scripts and a CloudFormation template to automate deployment and creation of architecture for 
                    the client.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Science Intern at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</h3>
            <h4>June 2019-August 2019</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>- Objective: Transferred data of patients and forms from over 110 registered sites from Syapse to a new platform in Rave 
                    EDC.
                </li>
                <li>- SAS/SQL: Utilized Macro language and PROC SQL queries to develop a program that parses through Syapse patient and drug 
                    data to create forms ensuring successful migration into the new data platform.
                </li>
                <li>- ML: Developed logistic regression and discriminant analysis models to evaluate factors of re-enrollment 
                    of patients in TAPUR cohorts.
                </li>
                <li>- Protocol Team: Communicated with the Data and Protocol Teams in agile meetings to understand the work-flow of patient 
                    and drug forms in the Healthcare Industry and earned a CITI certification.
                </li>
